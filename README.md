# TXT2GCT

This is a REALLY simple app made with Python that lets you convert a gecko code to a GCT File with a custom name (If you came from my website, there is a web version but it only let you use a six-letter game id)

You have to copy every line of the gecko code one at a time, I don't know Python that well yet to fix this if I'm honest.
